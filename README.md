# Chatgpt_Clone
This is a Chatgpt clone where I have used HTML, CSS and JS files

This project is a chatbot assistant that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model to generate responses to user input. The chatbot is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to be integrated into a website or web application. The code includes a function called ChatGPT that sends user input to the OpenAI API and displays the response in the chat window.
